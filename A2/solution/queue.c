    // sometimes preempt programs when we shouldn't. If we always break ties
    // at the head by keeping the current head, we won't do the initial setup
    // for T_AGING4 correctly.
    // The "best" solution is probably to have a different enqueue function
    // for the initial setup and for the re-queueing that happens later.
