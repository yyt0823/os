// The purpose of our queue is to manage scheduling.
// Ideally, we'd like to separate scheduling concerns from actually executing
// things -- including concerns about implementing preemption.
//
// We manage this by providing different functions for manipulating the PCB
// queue, which are each useful for various policies. The focus here is on
// queueing and dequeueing processes appropriately, and not on how they
// actually run.
//
// interpreter.h provides two functions:
//  1. run_pcb_to_completion
//  2. run_pcb_for_n_steps
// These functions can be used to actually _run_ the processes that we
// schedule, and are each useful for -- you guessed it -- various policies.
//
// The schedule_policy.{h,c} file defines a schedule_policy struct which
// contains pointers to the functions which will appropriately implement
// the tasks required by a particular policy. This allows us to expose a common
// interface, shared by all policies, that can be used to actually execute
// scripts. The details are handled in schedule_policy.c and interpreter.c.
//
// The interface we need to implement here contains a few functions:
//  1. void enqueue(struct queue *q, struct PCB *pcb)
//  2. void enqueue_ignoring_priority(struct queue *q, struct PCB *pcb)
//  3. struct PCB *dequeue(struct queue *q)
// We also need generic functions for allocating and de-allocating queues.
//
// To avoid duplication, see the documentation on the members of
// struct schedule_policy.

// Has to be defined before including schedule_policy,
// because schedule_policy.h requires this definition.
struct queue;

#include "schedule_policy.h"

// Note: we _could_ make functions in this file that are policy-agnostic,
// by including a policy as a member of the queue struct.
// This code simply is only used in one place, so there's no point.
// And anyway, probably a better plan would be to make a separate
// `struct scheduler` which contains both a policy and a queue,
// and provides policy-agnostic interfaces to everything in the schedule_policy
// and not just the queue stuff.

// All of our policies share a single queue type. If that weren't the case,
// we could add alloc/dealloc functions to the policy struct and replace
// struct queue pointers with void pointers everywhere.

struct queue *alloc_queue();
void free_queue(struct queue *q);

// To determine if processes have the same name, we need a way of scanning
// the queue contents for a given filename.
int program_already_scheduled(struct queue *q, char *name);

// This particular function is policy-agnostic, but its interface matches
// the regular enqueue function just to keep things clean.
void enqueue_ignoring_priority(struct queue *q, struct PCB *pcb);

// FCFS, RR
void enqueue_fcfs(struct queue *q, struct PCB *pcb);
// SJF
void enqueue_sjf(struct queue *q, struct PCB *pcb);
// Aging
// enqueue_sjf is almost correct, but we should leave the given pcb at the head
// if it's tied with the current head, rather than doing an FCFS tiebreak.
void enqueue_aging(struct queue *q, struct PCB *pcb);

// FCFS, RR, SJF
struct PCB *dequeue_typical(struct queue *q);
// Aging
